There is a lot of research available for win probability models in various sports.
However, there is much less research in predicting the number of points scored in a particular game.

This package implements the method described in the reference below, but 
for NCAA Men's Basketball, rather than the NBA.

Reference:
Song, K., Y. Gao, and J. Shi. 2020. 'Making Real-Time Predictions for NBA Basketball Games 
by Combining the Historical Data and Bookmaker’s Betting Line.' Physica A 547: 1–8
